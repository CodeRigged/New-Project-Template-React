## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

This will install all the needed dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `yarn add _` & `yarn remove _`

Add or Remove any un-/wanted dependencies.

## About

This is a project template I like and, if you are just getting started with coding, might help you. Feel free to use/change it. I might change it a little in the future. <br/><br/>
You may also make suggestions what one could add/should remove.

**Have Fun!**
